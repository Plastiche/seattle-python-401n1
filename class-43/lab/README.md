# Lab: 43 / 44 Back to the Basics

## Overview

Our old friend Pat is back. Many months ago you built Pat a great site for his up and comming business. Since you did such a great job, Salmon Coookies is a huge hit. With his success, his site has been overloaded with traffic. He is in need of some updates. You and your team have been re-hired to update his site. Some additions needed, local storage is not cutting it, Pat saw this thing online called a database and wants one.  With the pandemic in full swing, many of his customers want to be able to order online and have cookies shipped. He also wants the ability for store managers to log in to post their daily numbers, the ability for Pat to log in and see all store sales and online sales. Wants it to look good on a phone or tablet. He has other ideas, but would like you and your team to come up with other features.
